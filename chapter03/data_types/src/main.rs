// Can store from -(2^(n-1)) to (2^(n-1))-1 values
// n is the number of bits

// Compound types
// tuples and arrays
// Tuple
// A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
// The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they donâ€™t return any other value.
// Array
// Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
// Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isnâ€™t as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size. If youâ€™re unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector.
// Arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change.
